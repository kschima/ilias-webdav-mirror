This is a simple webdav mirror I use at FH Bielefeld
to mirror the contents of our e-learning platform ILIAS to 
a dropbox shared folder.

In mirrorReadMI.py:
* Edit username and password
* Edit the webFolder IDs and folder names according to your courses

Script fails if you don't own access permissions for each course

The webFolder ID a.k.a. ref_id can be found in the Ilias URL for each class

https://[university].de/ilias.php?ref_id=*471189*

Finally execute with Python 2

```
python mirrorReadMI.py
```
